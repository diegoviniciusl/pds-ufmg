# Project scope

The main objective of the system is to efficiently manage the entire process of a law firm, from the initiation of a trial process until its conclusion. To accomplish this goal, we are offering our users the capability to create and manage the essential entities required for this process, including users, companies, and trials.

Our system enables users to create trials that are connected to the companies that require legal action, and track the process status through multiple stages until completion. Users can easily update the trial progress and keep all stakeholders informed.

The system is designed to improve users' efficiency by providing a user-friendly interface that simplifies their work. The interface includes fast-loading tables with search and filter options that enable users to quickly access relevant information.

This new system is a significant improvement over the traditional approach of using Excel sheets in small law firms, which is prone to errors and duplication of data. With our system, users can focus on their core work, managing trials and delivering results, rather than managing administrative tasks and data inaccuracies.

# Main technologies

For the backend we will use Node.js with TypeScript, using fastify as the web framework and PostgreSQL together with Prisma (ORM) for the database handling.
On the frontend side we will use React with TypeScript.
